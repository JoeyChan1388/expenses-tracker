This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

# Help

This app incorporates JSON server so it cannot be deployed publicly on Github Pages, if you would like to see the app work, you will need to run it locally on your machine.

# Running Locally
Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed on your machine
Make sure you have Angular CLI installed using NPM with the command 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

Open the root folder in terminal and use the 'ng serve' commmand, this will start the local server on your machine,

Open up a secondary terminal in the same root folder and use the 'json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json' command this will start the fake REST API which is JSON server.
